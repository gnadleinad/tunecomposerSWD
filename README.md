# Design Overview
Give a concise overview of your design. How did you divide the code into classes and methods? 
How does your design for Project 3 differ from your design(s) for Project 2? 
What do you think is particularly elegant about the choices you made?

# Limitations
Explain what, if anything, in your solution is inelegant and why you didn't make it elegant 
(for example, maybe you didn't have time or the knowledge to fix it).

# Collaboration
Finally, describe how your team collaborated on the project. What did you do together? 
What did you do separately? What did each team member contribute? 
Optionally, include a brief team retrospective: 
What is one thing you did well as a team? 
What is one thing you could have improved?
